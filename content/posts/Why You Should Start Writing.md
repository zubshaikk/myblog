I am going to try to convince you to start writing.

Not because I'm some seasoned author, but because I'm someone who just started two weeks ago, and I wish I'd started sooner. The reason I started writing might surprise you: Artificial Intelligence.

In an age where AI can write poetry, craft emails, and even generate entire novels, I decided to start writing. And by the end of this post, I hope you'll understand why this isn't as deranged as it sounds and why you should join me.

## My story
Three weeks ago, I was like most people, impressed by AI, slightly intimidated by it, and wondering what it meant for creative work. I'd played around with a lot of different Large Language Models (LLMs), watched them effortlessly produce articles, essays and felt that familiar mix of amazement and anxiety. If machines could write this well, what was the point of human writing?

I read multiple AI-generated articles and found that while they were all technically perfect; they had good structure, clear points, proper grammar but they felt hollow. They read like someone had taken every article ever written about that certain topic and put it together to serve up the smoothest version. It was correct, but it wasn't *true*. It had information, but no insight. 

**That's when I realised; AI hadn't made human write obsolete. It made it precious.**

## The filtering
Here's what's happening right now, and why it changes everything; we're entering the age of infinite content. AI can generate blog posts, social media content, marketing copy, and even books faster than we can read and comprehend them. The internet, already drowning in information, is getting flooded with perfectly adequate, algorithmically optimized text.

In this new world, authentic human voice does not just stand out, it becomes a lifeline for readers desperately seeking something real. We're witnessing the filtering of human attention, where the choice isn't between good and bad content, but between synthetic and authentic.

When you write about your struggles with procrastination, you're not just sharing tips; you're sharing the specific, chaotic, human experience of fighting your own brain late at night. When you write about learning to code, you're not just explaining concepts; you're documenting the actual journey from confusion to clarity, complete with the embarrassing moments and the small successes that actually happened to you. AI can write convincingly about these experiences too, but it's synthesising patterns from data, not drawing from lived reality.

This is why writing has become almost a necessity. In a world of synthetic content, your real experience becomes invaluable.

## The Individual Benefit
This is where it gets personal; Writing isn't just about creating content for others, it's about transforming yourself.

I've only been at this for two weeks, but I've already notices something profound; writing forces you to think clearly in ways that nothing else does. When you sit down to write about something you care about, you can't just gesture vaguely or rely on the nowadays popular phrase "you know what I mean". You have to actually figure out what you mean and express it.

It's like having a conversation with the smartest version of yourself. You write a sentence, read it back, realize it doesn't quite capture what you're thinking, and try again. Through this process, you don't just communicate your ideas, you discover them, polish them, and often find they were different from what you initially thought.

Writing has become my thinking tool. Each time I find myself in a situation that I need to handle, I write and I emerge with clearer thought and better understanding every time. Writing is like thinking on paper, and thinking compounds. Every post you write, every idea you explore, every connection you make between concepts, it all builds on itself. You start to see patterns in your own thinking, develop your unique perspective, and build a body of work that reflects your intellectual journey. 

Writing doesn't just help you communicate better with others, it helps you communicate with yourself. It's like having a running conversation with your own mind, and the insights that emerge from that conversation are uniquely yours.

## Why now?
We're at a unique moment in history. AI is sophisticated enough to handle routine content creation, but not sophisticated enough to replicate authentic human experience. This gap between artificial capability and human authenticity creates an unprecedented opportunity for individual voices.

In a few years time, AI will be even better at generating text; but it will never be better at being human. It will never have those specific combination of experiences, insights, failures and breakthroughs. It will never see the world through the human lens or make connections the way our mind does.

But the question isn't whether AI will get better at writing, because it will. The question is whether you'll claim your unique space in the conversation before that space becomes even more valuable.

## The ripple effect
When you start writing, something happens, you begin to pay attention differently. You notice things you might have overlooked before because you're always unconsciously gathering information. Conversations become richer because you're thinking about how to articulate the insights they contain. Experiences becomes more meaningful because you're considering how to share their lessons.

Writing turns you into an active participant in your own life rather than a passive observer. You start living with intention because you know you'll be reflecting on and sharing what you learn.

## Starting is everything
Starting is hard. The first few posts feel awkward, like you're speaking into a void, wondering if anyone will read them, if you have anything valuable to say, if you're just adding to the noise.

But what I've learned in my brief two weeks; the value of writing isn't primarily in who reads it. It's in the writing itself. Every post makes you a clearer thinker. Every piece helps you understand yourself better. 

And yes, gradually, people do start reading. They find your work because it resonates with their own experiences. They share it because it articulates something they've been thinking but couldn't express. They follow your writing because your voice adds something unique to their understanding of the world.

## Your choice to make
We're living in a remarkable moment. Technology has given us tools that can handle routine cognitive tasks, freeing us to focus on what makes us uniquely human, our ability to make meaning from experience, to connect different ideas in original ways, to share our perspective with empathy and insight.

In a world increasingly filled with artificial content, your authentic voice isn't just valuable, it's necessary. We need your perspective, your questions, your insights, your way of seeing the world. It's how we contribute to the great conversation of our time. It's how we leave a mark of our thinking for others to follow and build upon.

The conversation is happening with or without you. But it's better with you in it.

So start writing.
