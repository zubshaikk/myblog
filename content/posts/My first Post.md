I'm Zubair, a Computer Science student specialising in Cyber security at The University of York. This is my attempt to turn scribbles and half-finished notes into something useful. What I've come to realise is that, learning to express what's swirling around in my head, explaining it on the page - is as important for me as it might be for anyone reading. Sharing those experiences, both the wins and the face plants is one of the best ways to learn, because articulating a thought often reveals gaps I didn't even know were there.
I sketched "The Content wheel" to show what you'll find on this blog, a circle divided into five uneven slices. Each slice represents a broad category of posts but none of them are polished or final,  just snapshots of my journey.

**Projects & Experiments**, represents the hands-on side of my work. These are the moments when I set up a test environment, ran into unexpected errors while configuring a lab, or discovered that a single misconfigured rule could break an entire network. 

**Technology Explainers**, is where I try to demystify whatever I happen to be learning at the moment without assuming you already know every piece of jargon. I'll cover the technology by showing not just how something functions, but how I struggled to understand it at first.

**Industry Trends and Opinions**, where I try to capture what's happening beyond my own experiments. I'll write about a new protocol announcement or a headline breach. By sharing the moment I first learned of a development, I unpack why it matters and what questions it raises for someone still learning the ropes.

**Career and Growth**, focuses on the soft skills and reflections that don't fit neatly into coursework. I'll share what happened when I stumbled through a system design question in an interview or how I balanced a looming assignment deadline with sending applications. These posts dig into the moments of rejection and small victories, because knowing how to handle both is as important as technical knowledge.

**Random Musings**, is a space for the little sparks of curiosity that pop up during my day. Maybe it's a late night "aha" moment about why my testing pipeline failed, or the moment I wonder how a simple shift cipher actually conceals data until I try implementing one myself.

If you're another student experimenting and learning or a fresh graduate, or someone who simply enjoys a candid, human perspective on tech, I hope these pages feel like a conversation rather than a lecture. I'll write about mistakes as often as successes because those "uh-oh" moments often teach the clearest lessons, and explaining them helps me learn to express myself more effectively.

Thank you for stopping by. I have no idea where this path will lead, but I'm excited to share each step and I'd love to hear where your journey takes you, too.
